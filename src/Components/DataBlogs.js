        Content: "Heliotherapy / light therapy was performed by many ancient nations, including those of Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, and Ancient Rome. The sun was also worshiped as a health-giving figure by the Inca, Assyrian, and early Germanic peoples. A treatment using herbs and natural sunshine to cure non-pigmented skin patches is described in Indian medical literature dating back to 1500 BCE. Similar references can be found in Buddhist literature from around 200 CE and Chinese records from the 10th century. Niels Finsen, a Faroese physician, is widely regarded as the father of modern phototherapy. For this, he created the first artificial light source. Finsen treated lupus vulgaris, a skin ailment caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with short wavelength light.He assumed the beneficial effect was due to ultraviolet light killing the bacteria, but recent studies revealed that his lens and filter system did not allow such short wavelengths to pass through, leading to the conclusion that light of about 400 nanometers generated reactive oxygen, which killed the bacteria.  Finsen also utilized red light to treat lesions caused by smallpox. In 1903, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. "

                <h4>SLEEP DISORDERS:-</h4>A meta analysis collected 53 studies with a total of 1154 participants concluded that light therapy is an effective treatment for general sleep problems.</li>
            <li>
                <h4>Seasonal affective disorder:-</h4>Another meta analysis studied data from 14 research centers with a combined 332 patients over five years. The analysis found 2,500 LUX intensity light exposure for a minimum of 2 hours daily for one week resulted
                in significant remissions of seasonal affective disorder.

                <h4>Non-Seasonal Depression:-</h4>A review article published in 2005 by Mount Sinai School of Medicine collected and reviewed various studies of light therapy and its effects on non-seasonal depression. The review found that light therapy achieved
                what medication drugs did in as little as one week compared to 4-16 weeks. 27 patients with nonseasonal depression were given seven days of light therapy and obtained a 24% benefit to light therapy over dim light. Another study used 3,000-4,000
                LUX ceiling lamps on 28 unmedicated patients and found that 50% improvement in 17of those cases.

                <h4>The lure of light therapy:-</h4>Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a kind of light therapy that uses specific wavelengths of red light to penetrate tissue and stimulate cells. Studies suggest that red light therapy can speed wound recovery,
                relieve pain, reduce inflammation, stimulate hair growth, and treat certain kinds of acne.

                Color and Light are the Same thing — You can’t have color without light, and you can’t have light without color. In simple terms we can say that if you are in a dimly lit room,you can’t see any colors except shades of gray.When the light starts to fade,
                so do the colors in your surroundings.If you are standing under an incandescent light, you are getting colored light rays from them. All light sources, whether artificial or natural, contain colored rays within them.

                There have been literally thousands of research studies about the healing effects of color and colored light, and the majority have been on Red and Blue wavelengths of Light.

                The Science of Light Therapy began to gain broader recognition in 2001, when NASA first discovered that RED and NEAR INFRARED (Near IR) light have very strong cellular regenerating effects. These lights have been shown to stimulate mitochondrial function
                in the cell.

                From research it has been found that soldiers with wounds healed much more quickly with far fewer infections and amputations when placed in the sun with their wounds exposed instead of being bandaged-up indoors. It came as a surprise to the Swiss heliotherapy
                (sun therapy) clinics that treated children with tuberculosis of the bones in the early 1900’s– their only treatment being sunbathing every day.

                We have been conditioned to believe incorrect and inaccurate reports that continue to be spread by the media and the medical and pharmaceutical industry for the past several decades. None of that hype is based on scientific research. It all started with
                someone making a lot of incorrect assumptions.So there have been many recent scientific studies that are confirming the cancer- and disease-preventing benefits of sunshine. Here some of these recent studies are described below.

                In 2014 researchers found a 20 year study on 30000 Swedish women who avoid sun exposure and die from any cause.These researchers claim that all the advice telling people to stay out of the sun unless wearing sunscreen may actually be harming them.

                Vitamin D is a hormone (not a Vitamin) vital to almost every cellular process in the human body. It’s naturally created in our bodies through exposure to UVB, especially during the summer months when UVB is strongest.Many studies have shown that Vitamin
                D is a very strong cancer inhibitor and it literally stops the growth of precancerous and cancer cells in their tracks when our levels are sufficient.

            </li>
            <li>
                Our bodies store Vitamin D in the summer months when we get regular sun exposure(Regular exposure means getting sunshine several times per week 15–60 minutes per day depending on your skin) and we use those reserves to work in the winter months when UVB
                is low and we can not make new Vitamin D from sunshine. Apart from vitamin-D we need melatonin hormone which is an antioxidant and cancer inhibitor.

        Content: "This is a red light therapy instrument that combines 660nm red light near infrared 850nm phototherapy lamp beads. 850nm infrared light is invisible to the human eye, so 850nm infrared light does not seem to work. In fact, it can penetrate deep into tissues, organs and joints. It is ideal for strengthening muscle recovery and reducing joint pain. 660nm deep red can be absorbed by the skin and repair skin problems. There are many benefits of these lights which are described below. It improves the circulatory system. The comprehensiveness and deep penetration of far-infrared radiation is the only physical therapy method that can completely take care of the countless microcirculation tissue systems throughout the body. After the microcirculation is smooth, the systolic pressure of the heart is reduced, the supply of oxygen and nutrients is sufficient, and the body is naturally light and healthy. It promotes blood circulation. The use of far-infrared response can increase the temperature of the deep hypodermic layer of the skin and extend the capillaries, thereby promoting blood circulation, resurrecting enzymes, strengthening blood and cell tissue metabolism, which is of great help to the overhauling of cells and can improve anemia."
