<div> Light therapy is an artificial light source that emits strong light.This aids our bodies in the production of melatonin and serotonin. After much research since the 1990s it found bright light therapy to be an effective treatment for many disorders.

<div> Sunlight 1 hour before sunset - 1000lux </div>
<div> Daylight - 5000 lux
    <div>
        <div>Daylight clear sky - 10000 lux</div>
        <div>Bright sunlight - 20000 lux</div><br>
        <div> It involves being exposed to bright light under certain conditions. It is made up of fluorescent lamps that are fitted in a box with a plastic diffusing screen and placed on a table where people can sit for treatment. It includes simply sitting
            near a light box with the light turned on and your eyes open. In this case, the body and head should be directed toward the lights, focusing on the light surface rather than the lights themselves. Sessions can range anything from 15 minutes
            to two hours, but they can be broken up into packets depending on the needs of the individual. It should be modified in terms of the amount of light and its duration.</div><br>
        <div> EFFECT OF VARIOUS LIGHT:-
            <ul>
                <li>Ultraviolet:- Produces vitamin D in the skin. Improves the flow of blood & lymph. Increases production of perspiration & oil.</li>
                <li> White light:- Relieves pain of the neck & shoulders Produces some chemical & germicidal effects</li>
                <li>BLUE LIGHT:- Treating jaundice (neonatal and other) Killing acne bacteria, Killing MRSA bacteria, and Increasing nitric oxide production in the skin to increase local blood flow and reduce pain.</li>
                <li>Red light and Infrared light:- Improves dry, scaled wrinkled skin and Relaxes muscles. accelerate healing of surface wounds. heal broken bones and injured muscle tissue. stimulate stem cell growth and nerve regeneration. treat arthritis
                    and injured joints.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </div><br> Types of light therapy devices
        <ul>
            <li>Light box:- These types of light therapy devices are more compact which make them much more portable and easier to use in tight spaces. Desk lamp:- These devices are the same as light boxes. The only difference is that these light therapy
                lamps shine downward from an upward position and these are larger in size.</li>
            <li>Light visor:- This shines light directly into your eyes from an upward angle.</li>
            <li>Dawn simulator:- These devices have built-in technology which gets brighter and dimmer to simulate the sun rising.</li>
        </ul>
        Three key elements for effectiveness:-<br> The wavelength, and the ability to deliver it in a sufficient quantity, over a sufficient time course in order to achieve a biological effect. Light therapy is most effective when you have a proper intensity
        of light and duration of time at which light is exposed on the patient.
        <ol>
            <li>Intensity. The intensity of the light box is recorded in lux, which is a measure of the amount of light you receive. For SAD, the typical recommendation is to use a 10,000-lux light box at a distance of about 16 to 24 inches (41 to 61 centimeters)
                from your face.</li>
            <li>Duration. With a 10,000-lux light box, light therapy typically involves daily sessions of about 20 to 30 minutes. But a lower-intensity light box, such as 2,500 lux, may require longer sessions. Check the manufacturer's guidelines and follow
                your doctor's instructions. He or she may suggest you start with shorter sessions and gradually increase the time.</li>
            <li>Timing. For most people, light therapy is most effective when it's done early in the morning, after you first wake up. Your doctor can help you determine the light therapy schedule that works best.</li>
        </ol> <br>PRONS OF LIGHT THERAPY: Light therapy is generally easy to start and adjust according to how it makes you feel.
        <ol>
            <li>Accessible:The treatment can be done at home using rented or purchased light boxes</li>
            <li>Noninvasive: It is not taken internally and serves as an alternative or supplement to medical interventions such as medications.</li>
            <li>Safe: Although there are some possible side effects, especially when the lamp is used incorrectly, light therapy is generally safe and low-risk.</li>
            <li>Convenient:You can use a light therapy lamp at home, while you read or eat breakfast. You can also stop light therapy for a few days without adverse effects or the return of symptoms.</li>
            <li>Associate with few or mild side effects: Most of light therapyâ€™s side effects, like headaches, dizziness, or nausea, are preventable by adjusting how you use the lamp.</li>
        </ol>
