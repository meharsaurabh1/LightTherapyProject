        This is a red light therapy instrument that combines 660nm red light near infrared 850nm phototherapy lamp beads. 850nm infrared light is invisible to the human eye, so 850nm infrared light does not seem to work. In fact, it can penetrate deep into tissues,
        organs and joints. It is ideal for strengthening muscle recovery and reducing joint pain. 660nm deep red can be absorbed by the skin and repair skin problems.

        There are many benefits of these lights which are described below. It improves the circulatory system. The comprehensiveness and deep penetration of far-infrared radiation is the only physical therapy method that can completely take care of the countless
        microcirculation tissue systems throughout the body. After the microcirculation is smooth, the systolic pressure of the heart is reduced, the supply of oxygen and nutrients is sufficient, and the body is naturally light and healthy.

        It promotes blood circulation. The use of far-infrared response can increase the temperature of the deep hypodermic layer of the skin and extend the capillaries, thereby promoting blood circulation, resurrecting enzymes, strengthening blood and cell tissue
        metabolism, which is of great help to the overhauling of cells and can improve anemia.
