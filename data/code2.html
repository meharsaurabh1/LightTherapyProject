        Color and Light are the Same thing — You can’t have color without light, and you can’t have light without color. In simple terms we can say that if you are in a dimly lit room,you can’t see any colors except shades of gray.When the light starts to fade,
        so do the colors in your surroundings.If you are standing under an incandescent light, you are getting colored light rays from them. All light sources, whether artificial or natural, contain colored rays within them.

        There have been literally thousands of research studies about the healing effects of color and colored light, and the majority have been on Red and Blue wavelengths of Light.

        The Science of Light Therapy began to gain broader recognition in 2001, when NASA first discovered that RED and NEAR INFRARED (Near IR) light have very strong cellular regenerating effects. These lights have been shown to stimulate mitochondrial function
        in the cell.

        From research it has been found that soldiers with wounds healed much more quickly with far fewer infections and amputations when placed in the sun with their wounds exposed instead of being bandaged-up indoors. It came as a surprise to the Swiss heliotherapy
        (sun therapy) clinics that treated children with tuberculosis of the bones in the early 1900’s– their only treatment being sunbathing every day.

        We have been conditioned to believe incorrect and inaccurate reports that continue to be spread by the media and the medical and pharmaceutical industry for the past several decades. None of that hype is based on scientific research. It all started with
        someone making a lot of incorrect assumptions.So there have been many recent scientific studies that are confirming the cancer- and disease-preventing benefits of sunshine. Here some of these recent studies are described below.

        In 2014 researchers found a 20 year study on 30000 Swedish women who avoid sun exposure and die from any cause.These researchers claim that all the advice telling people to stay out of the sun unless wearing sunscreen may actually be harming them.

        Vitamin D is a hormone (not a Vitamin) vital to almost every cellular process in the human body. It’s naturally created in our bodies through exposure to UVB, especially during the summer months when UVB is strongest.Many studies have shown that Vitamin
        D is a very strong cancer inhibitor and it literally stops the growth of precancerous and cancer cells in their tracks when our levels are sufficient.

        Our bodies store Vitamin D in the summer months when we get regular sun exposure(Regular exposure means getting sunshine several times per week 15–60 minutes per day depending on your skin) and we use those reserves to work in the winter months when UVB
        is low and we can not make new Vitamin D from sunshine. Apart from vitamin-D we need melatonin hormone which is an antioxidant and cancer inhibitor.
